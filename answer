As I first scrolled down plethora of information about the topic was already present. After watching all these I thought of adding some foundational details on the respective field of anonymity.
There is actually no true anonymity in internet. Actually the architecture of internet is built around this principle. The connecting device needs to know the address of the device intending to connect for transferring the packet without fail and this rudimentary principle of transferring the information in form of packet/datagram has raised question regarded true anonymity.
With the endeavour of some brilliant minds and the advancement of technology in bringing those efforts to general public we have been able to use some of the popular services like **VPN **or **TOR **or directing our request with the help of **proxy servers **all of these attempts are effortless unless you own these services on the private basis which is quite impossible in terms of **tor. **Since the anonymity of the user canâ€™t be thwarted if any stronger party determines to go through their record.Apparently, some advancement in encryption have bolstered our toil in achieving anonymity but the competence use of these cryptic technologies are still in development.
Although the names given to all of the above software or programs are different they all are built around the same scruples of **IP spoofing**. A **VPN ** redirects the packets sent from your device to the **VPN SERVER **and then finally sends to the destination. This principle is applied to both **TOR **and **PROXY SERVER. **In this way the server never knows the actual request is coming from your device. On the other hand they have their own set of so called non decipherable encryption algorithm which makes the exposure of IP address more secured. 
Now as a hacker the challenge use any of the above mentioned technique that will be suitable based on their potency to counter attack . What I mean is the bigger the victim the more vigorous solution is needed.
